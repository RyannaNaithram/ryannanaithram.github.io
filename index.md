## Hi, I’m Ryanna Naithram

Beltsville, MD · 240-217-6666 · [ryrynaithram@gmail.com](mailto:ryrynaithram@gmail.com)

I work where **space meets the atmosphere**—using satellite data to understand human activity and environmental change. My recent work spans **nighttime lights (VIIRS/Black Marble)**, **Sentinel-1 SAR**, **HLS**, and **fire detections**, with a focus on building clean, reproducible Python workflows.

## Research & Technical Experience

### NASA Applied Remote Sensing Training Program (ARSET) — Student Database Manager (May 2025–Present)
- Maintain and analyze participation datasets; build visuals that inform program decisions.  
- Coordinate weekly with the Goddard team; support global outreach.

### Earth System Science Interdisciplinary Center (ESSIC) — Research Intern (Jun 2025–Present)
- Validate **fused VIIRS + Sentinel-2** products for vegetation monitoring.  
- Develop advanced remote sensing analyses and QA workflows.

### University of Maryland — Undergraduate Researcher (Aug 2024–May 2025)
- Studied **GHG emission proxies** in Ukraine using **Black Marble NTL**, **Sentinel-1 SAR damage**, and **VIIRS fire**.  
- Built spatial correlation analyses and emissions maps to compare signal behavior across regions and time.

### Georgia Tech Research Institute (D.C. Field Office) — Research Intern (May–Aug 2024)
- Prototyped an **airborne LiDAR bathymetry** simulation for air–sea interaction studies.  
- Applied retrieval algorithms for ocean state parameters and integrated internal gravity wave models in Python.
