## Hi, I am Ryanna Naithram

Beltsville, MD · [ryrynaithram@gmail.com](mailto:ryrynaithram@gmail.com)

I work where space meets the atmosphere — using satellite data to better understand how people and the environment interact. Recently, I’ve explored nighttime lights (VIIRS/Black Marble), Sentinel-1 SAR, HLS, and VIIRS fire detections to track changes in activity, infrastructure, and ecosystems.

I enjoy making sense of complex datasets, building workflows that are easy to reuse, and combining different satellite perspectives to tell a more complete story about our planet.
